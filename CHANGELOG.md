## [2.5.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- **Cross-Platform Hardening:** `fcntl`→`msvcrt` fallback for Windows Git Bash, full TMPDIR/TMP/TEMP cascade, multi-platform `check-prerequisites.sh`, `shared/platform-support.md`, `platform.windows_mode` config, cross-platform CI matrix (macOS, Ubuntu, Windows Git Bash)
- **Build System Intelligence:** `build-system-resolver.sh` introspects Maven, Gradle, npm/pnpm/yarn, Go, Cargo, .NET with heuristic fallback. `module-boundary-map.sh` discovers multi-module project boundaries. Module-aware import resolution with confidence tagging (resolved/module-inferred/heuristic). Build graph quality metrics in state.json
- **Compression & Caveman Alignment:** Unified compression eval harness (`benchmarks/compression-eval.sh`), post-compression validation (`shared/compression-validation.py`) with 8 structural checks, caveman statusline badge `[STATUS: CAVEMAN]`, enhanced SessionStart auto-injection with full compression rule blocks, research references (arXiv:2604.00025)
- **Eval & Benchmarking Framework:** `evals/pipeline/` with eval-runner, 5 suite definitions (lite/25, convergence/10, cost/5, compression/5, smoke/5), 30 fixture stubs across 5 languages, baseline save/compare with regression detection, CI workflow for automated eval
- **Observability & Cost Management:** `cost-alerting.sh` with multi-threshold budget alerting (50/75/90/100%), `context-guard.sh` for quality-focused condensation at 30K tokens, E8 orchestrator intercept (advisory before hard ESCALATED), per-stage cost reporting, model routing cost optimization, enhanced forge-insights Category 3
- **AI-Aware Code Quality:** 4 new wildcard categories (AI-LOGIC-*, AI-PERF-*, AI-CONCURRENCY-*, AI-SEC-*) with 26 discrete sub-categories, 15 L1 regex patterns across 15 language files, cross-category dedup rule for AI-*/non-AI-* overlap, SCOUT-AI learning loop, reviewer guidance for fg-410/fg-411/fg-416
- `shared/agent-role-hierarchy.md` — complete dispatch graph and tier definitions for all 41 agents
- `shared/tracking/ticket-format.md` — FG-NNN ticket format documentation
- `shared/hook-design.md` — hook execution model, ordering, and script contract
- `allowed-tools:` frontmatter on all 40 skills

### Changed
- 15 skills renamed to `forge-*` prefix: bootstrap-project→forge-bootstrap, codebase-health→forge-codebase-health, config-validate→forge-config-validate, deep-health→forge-deep-health, deploy→forge-deploy, docs-generate→forge-docs-generate, graph-debug→forge-graph-debug, graph-init→forge-graph-init, graph-query→forge-graph-query, graph-rebuild→forge-graph-rebuild, graph-status→forge-graph-status, migration→forge-migration, repair-state→forge-repair-state, security-audit→forge-security-audit, verify→forge-verify
- All cross-references updated across 90+ files (skills, agents, CLAUDE.md, README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, shared docs, tests)
- Category registry expanded from 83 to 87 entries (23→27 wildcard prefixes)
- `/forge-deep-health` now documents fg-413 reviewer modes (full/conventions-only/a11y-only/performance-only)

### Deprecated
- `--sprint` and `--parallel` flags on `/forge-run` — use `/forge-sprint` instead

### Fixed
- `fcntl` import in `tracking-ops.sh` now uses try/except with msvcrt fallback (Windows compatibility)
- Incomplete `/tmp` cascade in `platform.sh:484` (`TMPDIR:-/tmp` → `TMPDIR:-${TMP:-${TEMP:-/tmp}}`)
- `BASH_SOURCE[0]` for path resolution in sourceable graph scripts
- Context-guard config parsing fallback when PyYAML unavailable

## [2.4.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- SessionStart hook — auto-activates caveman mode, displays forge status and unacknowledged alerts at session start
- `/forge-commit` skill — terse conventional commit message generator (<=50 char subject, why over what)
- `/forge-compression-help` skill — quick reference card for all compression features

- Agent eval suite (`tests/evals/`) — 41 canonical input/expected pairs for all 8 review agents with convention-coverage checks
- Compression benchmarks (`benchmarks/`) — input compression measurement via programmatic rules, output compression 3-arm eval harness
- Graph schema versioning (`shared/graph/schema-versioning.md`) with migration infrastructure
- 9 new scenario tests: oscillation, recovery budget exhaustion, safety gate, cross-repo, multi-framework composition, nested errors, mode transitions, feedback loop, preview gating
- 57 hook and skill behavioral tests (L0 syntax, check engine, feedback capture, checkpoint, automation trigger, compact check, skill integration)
- Compression semantic integrity tests (verify compressed files preserve category codes, severities, frontmatter, code blocks)
- Cross-reference audit tests (validate markdown links, orchestrator agent references)
- Module overview length enforcement test (15-line soft cap)
- Deprecation migration examples in DEPRECATIONS.md (before/after for all active deprecations)

- Angular TypeScript variant extended with standalone components, signals, built-in control flow, `@defer`
- Vue TypeScript variant extended with typed slots, typed refs, composable patterns
- Django Python variant extended with Python 3.10+ patterns (match statements, async views, Django 5.0+ features)
- Composition engine documents variant selection rules (explicit config > language matching)
- Skill count 38 → 40, hook count 6 → 7
- `MIN_UNIT_TESTS` guard bumped to 93, `MIN_SCENARIO_TESTS` to 40
- Structural check count 51 → 73+
- CLAUDE.md and README.md updated with all new skills, hooks, and test counts

### Fixed
- Race condition in WAL recovery (`forge-state-write.sh`) — mkdir-based lock before concurrent recovery
- WAL truncation race — moved inside write lock scope, cleanup on failure
- Token tracker retry without backoff — exponential backoff with jitter (5 retries)
- Non-atomic compact counter (`forge-compact-check.sh`) — mkdir-based lock
- Datetime format inconsistency — Z suffix added to all timestamp fallback paths
- Model detection substring collision (`forge-token-tracker.sh`) — longest-match-first pattern list

## [1.16.0] - 2026-04-12

### Changed
